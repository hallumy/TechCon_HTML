            <h2>History</h2>
            <p><strong>2010 – Humble Beginnings:</strong><br>
            TechCon was founded in 2010 as a small gathering of passionate tech enthusiasts in Nairobi. It began as a grassroots effort to bring together like-minded individuals who believed in the power of technology to drive change. Early events were characterized by intimate workshops, spirited discussions, and a focus on learning and collaboration.</p>
            In the years that followed, TechCon steadily grew in size and scope. The conference began to attract a wider audience, including startups, students, and professionals eager to share ideas and network. This period cemented TechCon’s role as a catalyst for knowledge sharing and community building within the regional tech ecosystem.</p>

            <p><strong>2015 – Expanded Horizons:</strong><br>
            By 2015, TechCon had transformed into a prominent platform for innovation, featuring expert panels, interactive demos, and keynote addresses from international leaders in technology. The conference’s expanded programming reflected a broader mission: to make emerging technologies accessible to all and to nurture cross-disciplinary innovation.
            These years saw TechCon increasingly highlight the ingenuity and creativity of African technologists and entrepreneurs. Local startups showcased their solutions to real-world challenges, from fintech and healthtech to agri-tech and renewable energy. The event became a place to celebrate African innovation and connect it with global partners.</p>

            <p><strong>2020 – Adapting to a New Era:</strong><br>
            The global pandemic in 2020 forced TechCon to pivot to a virtual and hybrid format. Despite these challenges, the event thrived, reaching participants across the continent and beyond. Virtual keynotes, online workshops, and hybrid networking sessions underscored TechCon’s resilience and adaptability.
            In recent years, TechCon has solidified its reputation as a movement, not just a conference. It has become a global platform to advocate for responsible, inclusive, and sustainable technology development. Today, TechCon continues to connect global and local leaders, foster a collaborative community, and inspire the next generation of tech talent.</p>
