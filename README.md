# TechCon 2024 Website

Welcome to the TechCon 2024 Conference Website! This project challenges you to build a comprehensive and accessible website using HTML, showcasing the key features and information about the TechCon 2024 event. Throughout this project, you’ll create multiple webpages, each focusing on specific aspects of the conference while incorporating essential HTML elements and following best practices for web development.

## Project Scope

The website includes five core pages:

✅ Homepage (index.html) – The landing page introducing TechCon 2024 and providing navigation to other sections.
✅ About Page (about.html) – A deeper look into the conference’s history, mission, and notable speakers.
✅ Schedule Page (schedule.html) – A detailed event schedule presented in an accessible table format.
✅ Register Page (register.html) – A user-friendly registration form for attendees to sign up for the event.
✅ Contact Page (contact.html) – Comprehensive contact information, including an embedded map, email links, social media links, and a “Contact Us” form.

This project serves as a practical introduction to building real-world, multi-page websites using semantic HTML and accessibility best practices. Dive in and make it your own!
